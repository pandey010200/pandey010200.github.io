> We do not choose mathematics as our profession, it chooses us. [*Yuri Manin*, [source](http://www.ams.org/notices/200910/rtx091001268p.pdf)]

> Mathematics is a process of staring hard enough with enough perseverence at at the fog of muddle and confusion to eventually break through to improved clarity. I'm happy when I can admit, at least to myself, that my thinking is muddled, and I try to overcome the embarrassment that I might reveal ignorance or confusion.
> Over the years, this has helped me develop clarity in some things, but I remain muddled in many others.
> I enjoy questions that seem honest, even when they admit or reveal confusion, in preference to questions that appear designed to project sophistication. [*Bill Thurston*, [source](http://mathoverflow.net/users/9062/bill-thurston)]

> I was lucky enough to attend a few lectures of S. S. Chern just before he retired from Berkeley in which he said that the cotangent bundle (differential forms) is the feminine side of analysis on manifolds, and the tangent bundle (vector fields) is the masculine side. From this perspective, Hamiltonian mechanics is the feminine side of classical physics, [and] its masculine side is Lagrangian mechanics. [*Richard Montgomery*, [source](http://people.ucsc.edu/~rmont/papers/Symm_in_Mech_Review.PDF)]

> ego cogito, ergo sum [*René Descartes*, [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum#Principles_of_Philosophy)]

> Suppose we loosely define a religion as any discipline whose foundations rest on an element of faith, irrespective of any element of reason which may be present. Quantum mechanics for example would be a religion under this definition. But mathematics would hold the unique position of being the only branch of theology possessing a rigorous demonstration of the fact that it should be so classified. [*F. De Sua*, cited in H. Eves's *Mathematical Circles*]

> I don't know what I may seem to the world, but as to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. [*Sir Isaac Newton*, *Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton* (1855) by Sir David Brewster (Volume II. Ch. 27) ]

> The only hope of a pure mathematician is to die before their work is applied. [[Source](https://www.quora.com/Is-all-mathematics-applied-mathematics-eventually/answer/Caleb-Vatral)]

> I can illustrate the ... approach with the ... image of a nut to be opened. The first analogy that came to my mind is of immersing the nut in some softening liquid, and why not simply water? From time to time you rub so the liquid penetrates better, and otherwise
you let time pass. The shell becomes more flexible through weeks and months — when the time is ripe, hand pressure is enough, the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado! A different image came to me a few weeks ago. The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of earth or hard marl, resisting penetration ... the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so far off you hardly hear it ... yet finally it surrounds the resistant substance. [*A. Grothendieck* in *R´ecoltes et Semailles*; translated by *C. McLarty* in *The Rising Sea: Grothendieck on simplicity and generality*, [Source](http://www.landsburg.com/grothendieck/mclarty1.pdf)]

> The law that entropy always increases holds, I think, the supreme position among the laws of Nature. If someone points out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell's equations — then so much the worse for Maxwell's equations. If it is found to be contradicted by observation — well, these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But if your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation. [*Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington*, The Nature of the Physical World (1927)]
