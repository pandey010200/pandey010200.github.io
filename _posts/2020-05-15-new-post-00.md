Hi. This is another attempt to blogging and learning new stuffs in the process. This one is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to write my posts. Let's see how this experience goes.

Support for latex is provided by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). For example, when $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \[ax^2 + bx + c = 0\] and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ This should be placed in the center hopefully \begin{align} \sin(x)=\frac{\pi}{2}. \end{align}
